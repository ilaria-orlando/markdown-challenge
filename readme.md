### A funny story ###   

My boyfriend and I went skinny dipping in the sea at night, at one point he couldn't find his phone, we called it with mine but couldn't hear a thing. We started pannicking because it was dark and this would've been the third phone in a year that was gone. He can't see anything in the dark so I put on his t-shirt and start looking with my flashlight. I walked down the street in thhe middle of the night to search if he hadn't lost it there. Meanwhile the police drive by asking me if everything is okay, and I have to explain to them, in just a t-shirt that I'm looking for my boyfriends phone. They leave me to search and after a 20 minute search my boyfriend calls me to tell me he found his phone in his shoes.   

#### Moral of the story, don't panic! ####
